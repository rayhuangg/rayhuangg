## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



# Research Project Overview
My research project consists of three main components:
![system](Data/system.jpg "system")

## 1. Hardware

A self-guided patrol 4-wheel robot, featuring AGX Xavier computing and Raspberry Pi for motor control.

### [AGX Xavier](https://github.com/rayhuangg/Asparagus_Car)
- Fuses front-view images (using ENet model) and 2D LiDAR data (using HDBSCAN clustering) for self-guided lane centering
- Implements UWB technology for indoor positioning

### [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/rayhuangg/Asparagus_Car_RPi)
- Controls the robot's motors

### [Automatic Robot Trajectory Evaluation Algorithm](https://github.com/rayhuangg/Research_Code)
- Assesses and analyzes the robot's movement paths

## 2. Software

Deep learning asparagus identification models (Instance segmentation), comparing two approaches:

### [Mask DINO](https://github.com/rayhuangg/Asparagus_MaskDINO)
- A transformer-based model
- Higher capability to learn complex features in asparagus growth images

### [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/rayhuangg/Asparagus_MaskRCNN)
- Traditional R-CNN model for comparison

### [Dataset Preparation](https://github.com/rayhuangg/COCO_dataset_generate)
- Generates COCO format datasets
- Serves as input for Detectron2 (PyTorch) models

## 3. Interface

A Django-based web application:

### [Greenhouse Asparagus Growth Management System](https://github.com/rayhuangg/Asparagus_web)
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and managing asparagus growth
